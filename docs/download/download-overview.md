The developer version enables you to load unpack extensions (apps that are not in the app store yet).

The difference between the developer version and the public version is defined by the `channel` flag, in the Overwolf installation folder, inside the setupInfo.ini file.
(e.g C:\ProgramData\Overwolf\Setup\SetupInfo.ini).
