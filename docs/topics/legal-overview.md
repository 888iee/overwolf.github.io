## Some Legal Stuff

As much as we would have preferred to just keep it simple and high-level, there are a few things that are important to understand before developing or using in-game apps. 

## Developer terms

Before you start sweating, here are a few notes about the developer terms:

1. We do not collect, sell or rent personal information without a user’s explicit permission, and neither should you.

2. You own the right and intellectual property for your app, we own the right and intellectual property of our platform.

3. We reserve the right to publish or remove your app. If it’s a good and legitimate application, we probably won’t have any reason to take it down.

4. If you plan to make money, here’s the deal – whatever you get paid, just like any other app store out there, Overwolf gets 30% unless we agree on something else in writing.

5. You should comply with Overwolf’s EULA and privacy policy.

6. This summary is here to help you, and not to replace comprehensive reading of the full Terms and Conditions.
