Users can leave reviews and rate your app in Overwolf’s AppStore. You can browse these ratings and reviews and reply to users from the dev console.

## Why is this important

Replying to reviews engages your users and makes them feel valued, helping to build loyalty. When you respond to negative reviews, it indicates how and when you'll address the feedback, where possible. Users will be more likely to leave a good rating and share your app following a positive interaction.

## Best practices

* Keep it concise and clear when addressing your user’s feedback.
* Strive for a friendly tone that’s consistent with the voice of your brand.
* Remain positive and respectful, even if it seems the user is attacking ("Your feedback helps us to improve") Clearly acknowledge the reviewer's feedback, and let them know you’re working on addressing the issue ("This is a known issue, and we're doing our best on working to fix it.")
* Use proper grammar and spelling. We advise using [Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/). 

## Pro Tips

* Personalizing your responses rather than using generic responses for similar reviews (e.g. "Hey Alex, thanks for your feedback.").
* When you release an app update that fixes issues mentioned in older reviews, consider replying to relevant reviews to tell these users about the fix.

## Manage your user's reviews

From the dev console, you can find the "User feedback" on the left navigation bar.
