## Developer's terms

DISCLAIMER: This agreement was written by a lawyer, which makes it only partly readable for normal human beings. So... before you start sweating, we would like you to know the following:

* We do not collect, sell or rent personal information without a user’s explicit permission, and nor should you.
* You own the right and intellectual property for your app, we own the right and intellectual property of our platform.
* We reserve the right to publish or remove your app. If it’s a good and legitimate application, we probably won’t have any reason to take it down.
* If you plan to make money, here’s the deal – whatever you get paid, just like any other app store out there, Overwolf gets 30% unless otherwise we agree on something else in writing.
* You should comply with Overwolf’s EULA and privacy policy.
* This summary is here to help you, and not to replace comprehensive reading of the full Terms and Conditions.
