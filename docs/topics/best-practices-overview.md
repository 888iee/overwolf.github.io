This page contains our best practices for developing and implementing your Overwolf app. It is the sum of our experience as well as the accumulated knowledge of our developer community. As our development platform and Appstore mature, and as we learn more with developersâ€™ experience, these recommendations will be updated. We would love to hear your own advice and learn from your experience, so please feel free to send us your feedback at developers@overwolf.com
