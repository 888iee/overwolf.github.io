A very useful plugin that we've developed is the **Simple IO Plugin**. This plugin allows your app to perform different filesystem I/O operations.

On the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/overwolf/overwolf-plugins/tree/master/simple-io-plugin) of the plugin you can [read  more](https://github.com/overwolf/overwolf-plugins/blob/master/simple-io-plugin/README.md) about the functions/properties/events of the simple-io-plugin.

## Common uses for the plugin

2. Creating your own persistent file on the local disk.
