A very useful plugin that we’ve developed is the [simple-io-plugin.](https://github.com/overwolf/overwolf-plugins/tree/master/simple-io-plugin) This plugin allows your app to perform different filesystem I/O operations.

It is very useful for:

1. Reading a game’s log file(s) and even “streaming” the log file, line-by-line, to your app.
2. Creating your own persistent file on the local disk.
