Each supported game able to display Overwolf apps in overlay has a unique Game ID. Game Ids are used in your app’s manifest.json [game_events](manifest-json#game-events-array) property.  
More information about game events per ID can be found [here](overwolf-games-events).

## Full list of Game IDs
The supported games list is always updated, and you can find it in your local Overwolf app data folder (after installing Overwolf of course).

1. Browse to your `%localappdata%` folder and open the `overwolf` folder.

2. Open the Game List XML file (named with a number postfix, for example gamelistXXX.xml, higher number means newer version), and search your game by name.

3. Under each game, you can find it’s game ID.

If you didn’t find the game you need, contact us through [Slack](../support/contact-us#join-our-slack) or by emailing developers@overwolf.com.
