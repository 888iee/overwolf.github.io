Each supported game (games that can display Overwolf apps overlayed) has a unique Game ID.  
The Game Ids used in your app’s manifest.json [game_events](manifest-json#game-events-array) property.  
More information about game events can be found [here](overwolf-games-events).

## Full list of Game ID's
The full list of the supported games with their Game ID’s is always updated, and you can find it in your local Overwolf app data folder (first you must install Overwolf of course):

1. Browse to your `%localappdata%` fodler and open the `overwolf` folder.

2. Open the Game List XML file (named with number postfix like gamelistXXX.xml. Higher number means newer version), and search your game by name.

3. Under each game, you can find it’s ID.

If you didn’t find the game you need, contact us through [Slack](../support/contact-us#join-our-slack) or by email to developers@overwolf.com.

## Game launchers ID's

(e.g LoL launcher/client) can be found [here](launchers-ids).
