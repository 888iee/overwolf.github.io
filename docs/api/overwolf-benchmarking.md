A set of functions for querying system stats and benchmarks. These calls require administrative permissions. To achieve administrative permissions the user may be prompted with a UAC message which can interrupt him while in game. In order to not interrupt the user, it is recommended to ask him before requesting permissions.

*Note*: The overwolf.benchmarking API is not regularly maintained and some of itâ€™s methods/events might not work as they should.
