## Promotion Basics

Once your app is ready for release or has a major feature rolling out, it’s a good time to get some new blood to join the fun!
Most creators promote their apps within their game communities and relevant social media channels independently, and that’s fantastic and quite effective. However, when an extra push is needed - you should talk to us, we have a talented marketing team dedicated to helping you.

## Requesting a Promotion

To initiate a promotion all you have to do is reach out to us, send a current build of your app, explain why it is time to promote and what kind of promotion you had in mind.
We can look into social media promotions, Youtube campaigns, Facebook campaigns, influencer marketing, performance campaigns or anything else that will serve your product’s growth - our team will figure out the best way forward based on your preferences and input.

## Further Support

Once a plan is developed, Overwolf will boost your promotion using our own channels.
When justified, we will support you with extra budget as well – up to doubling your own marketing budget.
