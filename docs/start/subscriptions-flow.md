## Subscribing from the app's page

The easiest way for a user to subscribe is going to that appâ€™s page in the Appstore and clicking the "Subscribe" button.

  <a data-fancybox="gallery" data-caption="The app's page (AKA 'OneApp' page), for unsubscribed users" href="../assets/subs-user-flow/one-app.jpg">
    One App page - Unsubscribed
    <span class="thumb">

    </span>
  </a>
</div>

## Subscribing using the in-app button

Developers can choose to implement an in-app subscribe button leading directly to the subscription flow. 

<div class="box" data-slick='{"slidesToShow": 1}'>
  <a data-fancybox="gallery" data-caption="In-app subscribe button" href="../assets/subs-user-flow/outplayed.jpg">

    </span>
  </a>
</div>

## Features screen and Checkout flow

After clicking "Subscribe", the user reaches a detailed plan page that breaks down all plan features.  
Currently, each app can only have one plan, but in the future multiple plans will be possible, each with different own feature sets.

</div>

## Manage active subscriptions

Subbed apps appear in a new settings page where users can easily monitor or cancel their subscriptions as they please. Cancellation takes place at the end of the current subscription period.

<div class="box" data-slick='{"slidesToShow": 1}'>
  <a data-fancybox="gallery" data-caption="Manage active subscriptions" href="../assets/subs-user-flow/settings-active-subs.jpg">

</div>

## Uninstall / Cancel subscriptions

When a user begins to uninstall Overwolf, they will get a notification warning them about active subscriptions that they might want to cancel for that app.

<div class="box" data-slick='{"slidesToShow": 1}'>
