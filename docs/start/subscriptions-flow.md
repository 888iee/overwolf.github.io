## Subscribing from the app's page

The easiest way for a user to subscribe is going to that appâ€™s page in the Appstore and clicking the "Subscribe" button.

## Subscribing using the in-app button

Developers can choose to implement an in-app subscribe button leading directly to the subscription flow.

## Plan & Features screen

After clicking "Subscribe", the user reaches a detailed plan page that breaks down all plan features.  
Currently, each app can only have one plan, but in the future multiple plans will be possible, each with different own feature sets.

## Checkout flow

After users review each feature set and find one to their liking, they click "Subscribe".  
The next step is a quick checkout flow on our payment gateway, XSolla, which supports various payment methods.

## Manage subscription screen

Subbed apps appear in a new settings page where users can easily monitor or cancel their subscriptions as they please. Cancellation takes place at the end of the current subscription period.
