## Overview

Knowledge base is what we call your public library. If users want to know anything about your app, they can open it up and read all about it.

### Basic rules

* Always write the article on the wordpress editor, and do not copy & paste from another program. If you prefer to write it elsewhere, make sure to clear all text formatting before pasting it into the wordpess editor.

* Keep your article clean, organized, clear, and follow a consistent structure.

* Pay attention to grammar (We can help you with that).

### Best practices

* Please remember that users that just installed your app, never used it before and probably need assistance/guidance in order to understand the app’s features and easily start using it properly. A successful FTUE (First Time User Experience) greatly increases the chances of retaining your users. You can read more about it [here](https://medium.com/overwolf-developers/apps-ftue-best-practices-670dd4fb2b10).

* The articles (What is, FAQ, Troubleshooting) should have all the available information on the app that the user might need.

* Screenshots & GIFs for the articles are strongly recommended.

* When adding screenshots to your article, make sure the image is clean, taken with either a black or white background and only shows what needs to be seen by the user.

* If you mark or highlight anything in your screenshots, please do it in an aesthetic way (symmetric rectangles, circles, arrows).

* Try to keep all the images in the article in a consistent size. Make sure the images are not too big for the article but also not too small so the text is still readable.

* These articles can be accessed from the ‘?’ icon in your app’s main screen.

* In addition, feel free to add more articles, such as Changelog, Requirements, etc.

### Writing guidelines

* Header – A short, "enthusiastic" description on your app. Size = Heading 3.

* Headlines – To keep your article organized, you will probably have a few headlines. Keep them in size = Heading 4 and formatted bold.

* Text content – All the texts should be written in size=Normal and not be formatted either bold or italic, unless there is a need to emphasize something specific.

A good example for an organized knowledge base is "[CSGO Scout](http://support.overwolf.com/article-categories/csgo-scout/)".

### Mandatory articles

The two mandatory articles that an app should have are:

#### What is

This article explains the general use of the app. Legendary Builds does this by splitting the app to two separate segments:
First part is focused on the out of the game experience. On this part, the articles goes step by step, screen by screen (of the app) and explains every feature that is shown on screen.
The second part is focused on the In-game experience it will guide the user step by step.

A good example for this kind of article:

[What is CSGO Scout](http://support.overwolf.com/knowledge-base/what-is-csgo-scout/) – General explanation about the app.

#### Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

This article answers questions that users might have. If you have been contacted by users with questions that you think are repetitive or are important, this is the place to answer them!

A good example for this kind of article:

[CSGO Scout](http://support.overwolf.com/knowledge-base/csgo-scout-faq/)

#### Troubleshooting

This article should contain common issues that exist in the app, and how to fix them. Like the FAQ, you might have encountered some issues that users had. This is the place to show users how to fix them.

A good example for this kind of article:

[Legendary Builds – Troubleshooting](http://support.overwolf.com/knowledge-base/troubleshooting-2/) – Common issues that the app might have, and how to fix them
