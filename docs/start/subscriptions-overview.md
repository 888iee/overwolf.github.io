Even though our ads are forgivable and show up in the best possible times to not bother gamers as they play, some users still demand to remove ads entirely. Following that feedback, we’ve set up a new tool in your monetization arsenal - app subscription. 

Users are now able to pay a monthly cost to become premium users of your app and get special perks and services in return. We encourage you to think up cool ways to reward premium users and improve their experience beyond just removing all ads from the subscribed app. 

Subscriptions don’t only provide you with a stable source of income, it brings your users closer to you and increases their involvement in your project - they are backing your continued development, remember to show them some love!

## Subscription Basics

A complete user flow can be found [here](subscriptions-flow).  

A detailed instruction on how to implement subscriptions in your app can be found [here](subscriptions-integration).

Any application can launch a subscription program based on removing ads, but we strongly recommend developing new perks and benefits for Premium users to ensure paying customers to feel like they got good value for their investment.

## Who can sub?

Any of your users with a Paypal account or international credit card can subscribe to an app.
