## What’s Overwolf

Overwolf’s mission is making game experiences even more awesome, we do that by empowering independent developers to create PC game apps with full in-game event integration.

We’re a team of passionate gamers developing an SDK that empowers you as a developer to turn a dream concept into reality and integrate with top games in a fast, scalable and legal way. 

Our platform is created for you, and we’ve come up with multiple ways to reduce noise and free you up to build your app beyond our SDK - marketing services, design support, QA and more. In the past year, we’ve also been funding app development projects directly via our joint fund with Intel. If you have a great app concept and you want to turn your passion into a profession - [apply here!](https://www.overwolf.com/fund/home)

## What’s on this website?

While we are here to answer any questions and support your success, our new developer website has everything you need to start working on your app right away.

The left-hand side menu has detailed instructions for every stage of the project, from submitting a concept all the way to optimizing your app after release. You may also find our [full documentation](../topics/best-practices-overview) as well as a [detailed break-down of APIs](../api/overwolf-api-overview) in the top menu.
