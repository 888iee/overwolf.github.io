## Submitting an App Proposal

So, you have a great idea for an Overwolf application. Now what?

Before you jump into developing your app, why not tell us a little about what you have in mind? This means putting together a simple app-proposal, laying out your idea, what kind of features you would like to implement, and some visual mockups so we can see what the app will look like.

The idea is to show us what your app is all about before you invest time and effort into development. It also gives us a chance to provide feedback for the app, and to underline any issues ahead of time.

### Tips for a Great Proposal

To help you prepare a kick-ass proposal, here’s what we recommend you do first:

* **Check out what’s already out there.**

[Look over the apps in our Appstore](overwolf.com/appstore), especially the ones that are similar to your proposed idea. Think of what your app can do better, or what it can offer that similar apps don’t.

* **Review the documentation**

Whether you’re new to Overwolf developers or a returning developer, it’s imperative you go over our documentation. We’re constantly updating our documentation with current features, so this is the best way for you to remain up-to-date on all of our tools and features you can harness.

### Prepare Your Proposal

Submitting your app idea for review is easy. We’re not looking for a complete set of technical documents at this point. Instead, we’re looking for a clear, concise description of what the app is and how it will work. We also want to see a mockup of your User Interface. This proposal (and the app itself) must be in English, although you may freely support more languages in the completed app.

### Legal

Before submitting your app proposal, please read the [developer](https://overwolf.github.io/docs/topics/legal-developers-terms) & [app](https://overwolf.github.io/docs/topics/legal-app-terms) terms.

## What's next?

We’ll let you know if your proposal is approved or rejected within 4 business days.

* Approved app proposals:

Great job and a big thumbs up! We looked at your idea and we think it’ll be a great fit for the Overwolf Appstore. Now the real fun begins! Go ahead and start developing your app.
Reach out to us if you need assistance or browse our documentation for existing solutions.

* Rejected app proposals:

After reviewing your app concept, we suggest trying for a different concept. This app will not fit our App Store because X Y Z, but we were positively impressed with your abilities and are looking forward to seeing more ideas from you soon! You won’t be able to submit this app for review later, but we encourage you to let us know if you have another idea that might be a better fit.
