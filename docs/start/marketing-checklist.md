Your app is live on the Overwolf Appstore! Now what? If you followed the [technical checklist](technical-checklist) it is a good time to take a look at the marketing checklist to ensure a smooth launch and that long-term growth goals for your app are met.

We don’t want to dictate exactly how you should promote your app. You know your users best, and what works for someone else may not work for you. With that in mind, here are some ideas for how to promote your app, based on best practices and lessons that we’ve learned. Use these ideas (or don’t) as it suits your audience.

We divided the checklist to three levels, so you can take your time and follow it step by step.
Once you complete the full list of recommendations, you could get up to a 3% improvement in your rev-share.

The Overwolf team is here for you and we’ll be happy to evaluate your strategy and goals and assist in any way we can.
