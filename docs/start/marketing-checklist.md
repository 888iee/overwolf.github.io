So, your app is live on the Overwolf Appstore, and you've already gone through the [technical checklist](technical-checklist). Now is a great time to review your marketing efforts with this checklist to ensure a smooth launch and better chance of achieving your app's long-term growth goals.

There is no one 'correct' way to market and promote apps. You know your users best, and promotions that worked for one app doesn't necessarily apply for a different audience of gamers. With that in mind, here are some ideas for promoting your app effectively based on best practices and lessons that we’ve learned. Use those ideas that fit your app and audience.

The checklist has three tiers, please take your time and follow it step by step when you are able.
Since we're all here to benefit users with great apps, completing the checklist of recommendations fully will increase your share of the revenues by up to 3%.

The Overwolf team is here for you and we’re happy to evaluate your strategy and assist in any way we can.
