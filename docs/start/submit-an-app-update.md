## Overview

Your app is available on the Overwolf Appstore but you keep working to improve it. That’s awesome! You can send us a new version of the app whenever it’s ready.

## Submit a new version

Feel free to send the new version (including a detailed change log) to [developers@overwolf.com](mailto:developers@overwolf.com). You can also contact the Overwolf team through the Overwolf Developers Slack with the required information.  

Please make sure to keep it in the same format as your first submitted app, rather than sending fragmented files.
Also make sure to update the [app version](../api/manifest-json#meta-object) in the manifest. If nothing changed in your store assets, there’s no need to submit it (the app folder will do just fine).
