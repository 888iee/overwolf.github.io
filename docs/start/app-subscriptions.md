## Overview

Even though our ads are forgivable and show up in the best possible times to not bother gamers as they play, some users still demand to remove ads entirely. Following that feedback, we’ve set up a new tool in your monetization arsenal - app subscription. 

Users are now able to pay a monthly cost to become premium users of your app and get special perks and services in return. We encourage you to think up cool ways to reward premium users and improve their experience beyond just removing all ads from the subscribed app. 

Subscriptions don’t only provide you with a stable source of income, it brings your users closer to you and increases their involvement in your project - they are backing your continued development, remember to show them some love!

## Subscription Basics

To sub to an app, all a user has to do is go to that app’s page in the Appstore and click the ‘Subscribe’ button, or if the developer chose to implement it use the in-app subscribe button. That’ll send them to a quick checkout flow on Paypal and return them once a subscription is successfully completed. 

Subbed apps appear in a new settings page where users can easily monitor or cancel their subscriptions as wanted. Cancellation takes place at the end of the current subscription period. 

Any application can launch a subscription program based on removing ads, but we strongly recommend developing new perks and benefits for Premium users to ensure paying customers to feel like they got good value for their investment.


## Who can sub?

Any of your users with a Paypal account can subscribe to an app. We’re planning to open up more payment channels down the road but for this first round of subscriptions, it’s Paypal only. 


## Preparing subscription assets

Before implementing subscriptions into your app, prepare the core assets required for this implementation including store assets, potential landing page materials and anything else you’re going to need. 

As mentioned above, any premium-only features need to be tested and polished before becoming available. Remember that paying customers and free users have different standards and expectations from you as the app’s creator.
