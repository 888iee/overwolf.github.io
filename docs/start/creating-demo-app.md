To help you get a feel of Overwolf's API, here's an explanation on how to create a simple app that displays the name of the game you are currently playing.

We`ll describe two different methods, one with the demo app as a base, and another working from scratch.
It is best to review each method, so you can better understand the development process.

## create demo app from scrarch

To use the sample app as a base, please follow these steps:

1. Download the latest [Developers version of Overwolf](https://download.overwolf.com/install/Download?Name=Game+Summary&ExtensionId=flkgdpkkjcoapbgmgpidhepajgkhckpgpibmlclb&Channel=developers).

2. To be added

## download demo app

[This repository]() contains the Overwolf sample app, that targeted for Fortnite. Why Fortnite? because it's popular and free. Anyway, you can easily customize this sample to fit any other supported game.

The apps demonstrate our best practives like background controller, custom hotkey, ad display and much more. You can read all the details in the repo readme.
