Our "gist" GitHub repository is typically used to share files and snippets with others quickly. 
You can upload new gists and browse other gists that uploaded by the Overwolf developer's community.

:::important
We will try to review and test every new gist, but please note that these are community code snippets, and not Overwolf official code blocks.  
The usage is at your own risk.
